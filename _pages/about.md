I am a dedicated researcher and a trained educator with extensive teaching experience across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels in diverse cultural and educational settings, including Ghana, Norway, the UK, and Canada. My background in applied mathematics, statistics, and computational programming allows me to effectively communicate complex concepts through relatable, real-life illustrations.


Research Interest
======
My research focuses on applied and computational statistics, particularly in modeling high-dimensional biological data. Most recently, I have been developing statistical models and software tools to advance research in the human microbiome.
